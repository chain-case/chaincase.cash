# Sunsetting Chaincase iOS TestFlight Beta

<span class="by-line">by Dan Gould · 2022-08-01</span>

In 2022 we're keeping laser-eyes focus on the problem Chaincase set out to solve: Commerce is getting captured by surveillance.

In the hundreds of conversations with enthusiastic iOS Beta users, we discovered the fundamental bottlenecks on bitcoin privacy. Having an iOS app is not one of them. Early adopters, we thank you sincerely. Your feedback is shaping the bright future of bitcoin privacy.

Since the our most promising opportunity to solve the surveillance problem lies outside the iOS app we've decided to shut it down. The Chaincase iOS Beta will expire on November 1, 2022. Funds must be moved before then. Chaincase support will be available on telegram at [t.me/chaincase](https://t.me/chaincase) to facilitate the transition. We are excited to share bitcoin tech that plugs into popular software so that everyone has access to better privacy. Stay tuned.

## Export Options

The following is a guide on the software most compatible with Chaincase. If you're a desktop user, the easiest transition is to Wasabi wallet.

### Wasabi Wallet

Wasabi Wallet ([wasabiwallet.io](https://wasabiwallet.io)) uses the same wallet file format as Chaincase.

From the Chaincase Settings menu, tap "Export Wallet File" to bring up the share drawer. The secrets in this wallet file are encrypted. We recommend you move this file to the computer where Wasabi is installed using AirDrop or another encrypted file drop. The file must be placed inside the Wasabi Wallets Folder.

- Windows: `/Users/{your username}/AppData/Roaming/WalletWasabi/Client/Wallets`
- Linux: `/home/{your username}/.walletwasabi/client/Wallets`
- macOS: `/Users/{your username}/.walletwasabi/client/Wallets`

You may need to mark the “show hidden files” setting to see it.

You can open the folder from inside Wasabi, too: `File > Open > Wallets Folder`

Once inside the Wasabi Data Folder, restart Wasabi and your bitcoin will be visible after Wasabi finds it by scanning bitcoin network data.
